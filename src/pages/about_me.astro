        I bridge the gap between hands-on development and strategic leadership.
        I specialise in mentoring technical teams, establishing robust MLOps workflows,
        and translating complex AI concepts for senior stakeholders.
        My focus is on building scalable, end-to-end ML solutions, from platform
        infrastructure to cutting-edge GenAI applications.
        <br></br>
        I am an effective support to teams both as a mentor and an extra pair of hands when needed.
        Some of the pieces of work I've done include:
      </p>
      <ul class="work-list">
        <li>Architecting and building a scalable ML platform to accelerate the model development lifecycle</li>
        <li>Leading and scaling Data Science teams to deliver revenue generating products</li>
        <li>Championing AI adoption by developing and delivering technical workshops to both engineering and business teams.</li>
        <li>Engineering robust MLOps infrastructure that accelerated model deployment time from hours to minutes</li>
        <li>Applying cutting-edge GenAI techniques to solve real-world problems like cost estimation and structured data extraction from video </li>
      </ul>
