      <h2>Professional Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in the power of continuous learning and search as fundamental approaches 
        to both personal growth and problem-solving in AI. The rapidly evolving landscape 
        of machine learning demands constant adaptation and a willingness to explore new 
        ideas and techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach to ML engineering emphasizes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pragmatic Solutions:</strong> Building systems that work reliably in production, not just in notebooks</li>
        <li><strong>Team Enablement:</strong> Creating infrastructure and processes that help teams move faster</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Iterating based on real-world feedback and metrics</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Contributing to the community through open source and writing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Beyond Work</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of machine learning, I have diverse interests that keep life interesting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Travel:</strong> Exploring new cultures and cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia and Europe</li>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Home automation, audio equipment, and staying current with tech trends</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Pursuits:</strong> Photography, cooking, and experimenting with generative art</li>
        <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Science fiction, thought-provoking TV shows, and immersive gaming experiences</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I'm leading ML initiatives at {introContent.company}, where we're revolutionizing 
        the automotive marketplace through intelligent systems. I'm particularly excited 
        about our work with Large Language Models and how we're applying them to create 
        better user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I'm exploring the intersection of generative AI and creative 
        applications, contributing to open source projects, and sharing knowledge through 
        technical writing.
