    <h1>Hi, I'm Andrew Ginns</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">
      I'm a Lead Machine Learning Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable ML systems 
      and leading data science teams. Currently working at Motorway, where I'm focused on developing 
      innovative MLOps solutions and production-grade machine learning pipelines.

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design and implement end-to-end machine learning pipelines</li>
        <li>Lead and scale data science teams</li>
        <li>Build MLOps infrastructure for rapid model deployment</li>
        <li>Apply cutting-edge AI techniques to solve real-world problems</li>

      <h2>Recent Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models, generative AI, and building robust 
        MLOps workflows. My work has reduced deployment times from half a day to just 2 hours, 
        and I've successfully scaled teams from 2 to 16 members while maintaining technical excellence.
