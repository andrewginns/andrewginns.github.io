      <p>
        I have proven track record as an accomplished individual contributor,
        excelling in technical mentorship, establishing team workflows and patterns,
        and collaborating effectively with senior technical and non-technical stakeholders.
        <br></br>
        My experience in the full DS and ML stack and end-to-end projects, as well as expertise
        in GenAI make me an effective support to teams both as a mentor and an extra pair of hands where needed.
        Some of the pieces of work I've done include:
      </p>
      <ul class="work-list">
        <li>Designed and implemented a machine learning platform</li>
        <li>Lead and scaled Data Science teams</li>
        <li>Workshops and talks on applied GenAI techniques/showcases</li>
        <li>Built MLOps infrastructure for rapid model deployment</li>
        <li>Applied cutting-edge GenAI techniques to solve real-world problems</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="focus-section">
      <h2>Recent Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models, Agentic System, and building robust 
        MLOps workflows.
