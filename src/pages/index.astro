      <h2>Recent Focus</h2>
      <p>
        I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models, generative AI, and building robust 
        MLOps workflows. My work has <strong>reduced deployment times from half a day to just 2 hours</strong>, 
        and I've successfully <strong>scaled teams from 2 to 16 members</strong> while maintaining technical excellence.
